abstract="Over the past few years a number of researchers in mathematical programming and engineering became very interested in both the theoretical and practical applications of minimax optimization. The purpose of the present paper is to present a new method of solving the minimax optimization problem and at the same time to apply it to nonlinear programming and to three practical engineering problems. The original problem is defined as a modified leastpth objective function which under certain conditions has the same optimum as the original problem. The advantages of the present approach over the Bandler-Charalambous leastpth approach are similar to the advantages of the augmented Lagrangians approach for nonlinear programming over the standard penalty methods.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a smoothing method for minimax problem. The method is based on the exponential penalty function of Kort and Bertsekas for constrained optimization. Under suitable condition, the method is globally convergent. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate the promising of the algorithm.",

abstract="We present a new feedback precision-adjustment rule for use with a smoothing technique and standard unconstrained minimization algorithms in the solution of finite minimax problems. Initially, the feedback rule keeps a precision parameter low, but allows it to grow as the number of iterations of the resulting algorithm goes to infinity. Consequently, the ill-conditioning usually associated with large precision parameters is considerably reduced, resulting in more efficient solution of finite minimax problems.",
