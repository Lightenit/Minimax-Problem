abstract="We present a new feedback precision-adjustment rule for use with a smoothing technique and standard unconstrained minimization algorithms in the solution of finite minimax problems. Initially, the feedback rule keeps a precision parameter low, but allows it to grow as the number of iterations of the resulting algorithm goes to infinity. Consequently, the ill-conditioning usually associated with large precision parameters is considerably reduced, resulting in more efficient solution of finite minimax problems.",
